Lab | Hypothesis Testing

Instructions

It is assumed that the mean systolic blood pressure is μ = 120 mm Hg. In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of n = 100 people had an average systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood pressure!) from the regular population?


1) Set up the hypothesis test.

Ho: μ !=120 mm Hg
Ha: μ = 120 mm Hg


2) Write down all the steps followed for setting up the test.
It is a two-tail test
Fix the confidence level. = 95 %
Significance level a=0.025

If the test statistic is in the allowed region, (the allowed region is determined by the confidence level) fail to reject  the null hypothesis, otherwise reject the null hypothesis.



Calculate the test statistic by hand and also code it in Python. It should be 4.76190. What decision can you make based on this calculated value?

T=21.21
mean of population

T=(x-μ)/ X/10

21.21 = (130.1-120)/ X/10

X=4.7619

tc = +-scipy.stats.t.ppf(0.975, df=99)
-1.9842169515086827

The test statistic is not in the allowed region
Our t = 4.7619 > + -1.9842 =tc-> the null hypothesis is rejectet
